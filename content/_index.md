title: Welcome to Speechly Docs
description: "With Speechly you can easily add voice functionalities to any user interface. We provide speech-to-text and natural language understanding features, both accessible via a simple API using ready-made client libraries. All you need to do is provide a small amount of training data for our machine learning models, and integrate one of the client libraries to your application."
