This documentation site is a part of Speechly's Spoken Language Understanding developer tools. The documentation is divided into five different sections, each of which have a number of subsections for further learning.

- [Quick Start](/quick-start/) goes through the basic steps to create your first voice application in the Speechly Dashboard
- [Configuration](/slu-examples/) teaches you through Speechly Annotation Language (SAL) that is used to configure your voice application
- [Integrations](/client-libraries/) is about integrating your configured voice application to your application or website by using our Client Libraries
- [Speechly API](/speechly-api/) contains description of our API and API references for our APIs
- [FAQ](/faq/) is for the Frequently Asked Questions

## What is Speechly?

Speechly offers a full suite of developer tools that enable adding real-time Spoken Language Understanding (SLU) features easily to any product or service across different platforms. The suite consists of:

- **[SLU API](/speechly-api/)**: Speechly's fully streaming SLU API returns text transcription and user intent and entities in real-time from speech.
- **[Libraries & SDKs](/client-libraries/)**: Speechly offers a range of libraries and SDKs for different platforms, making plugging into the Speechly SLU API easy.
- **Development tools**: Tools for analyzing and optimizing the SLU models help developers improve their real-time voice experiences.

Speechly is a end-to-end solution for voice user interfaces. The process to create a Speechly application goes as follows:

1) **Create and configure a Speechly application**
The simplest way to configure a Speechly application is by using our web Dashboard. For collaboration we recommend our command line configuration tool and version control with git or similar tools.

2) **Integrate to your application**
Once the configuration is deployed and tested in Playground, you can integrate it to your application by using our client libraries. 

3) **Iterate**
Test your application with real people and learn about the language they are using with your application to improve your configuration.

Simple way to build a real Speechly application is to follow our [React tutorial](/client-libraries/react/tutorial/).


Speechly currently supports English and Finnish.

## How to get started?

Getting started with Speechly is easy! You just need to create an account and design your first SLU example template in order to start playing around with your newly created voice UI. Follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](/quick-start/) section to get up to speed.

Once you've completed the tutorial, you can read more about [SLU Examples](#) to improve your example template. Then you can move on to integrating your SLU model to your application with the help of our [Client Libraries](/client-libraries/).

You can also use our [React Client](/client-libraries/react/tutorial/) to build a simple application with Speechly.
