The Speechly gRPC API is the low-level API for integrating your application with Speechly. For most users we strongly recommend using the [Client Libraries](/client-libraries/). The gRPC API is mainly for users who cannot use the Client Libraries.

Knowledge of [gRPC](https://grpc.io) is a prerequisite before taking this API into use.

Here you can find
- a [gRPC API Guide](api-guide) that explains how the gRPC API works in general, and
- the [gRPC API Reference](api-reference) that contains all details of the API.

A good source of information about our gRPC API is also its [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/speechly/api).
