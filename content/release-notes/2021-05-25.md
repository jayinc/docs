- **ASR improvements**: New baseline ASR model.
- **Dashboard**: The dashboard now has a button ("SHOW SAMPLE") that displays a set of random example utterances generated from the given SAL configuration.
- **Web UI components**: Major update with a unified API for both JS and React, a new TranscriptDrawer component with just-in-time usage hints for an improved user onboarding experience, a listening prompt to indicate when the app is listening, and a developer-triggerable command to acknowledge that an utterance was received.
