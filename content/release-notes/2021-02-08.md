- **Debugging models in Speechly CLI tool**: New debugging feature in Speechly CLI tool displays example utterances for a given configuration and calculates statistics about occurrences of intents and entities.
- **Support for unadapted ASR**: Typically Speechly SLU models are adapted for a specific use case, which helps improve speech recognition accuracy. Now you can also use unadapted ASR for pure transcription use cases. You can test the speech recognition performance [here](https://api.speechly.com/dashboard/#/playground/ead4b9e7-e5c4-48ed-9dae-3c530916ed76?language=en-US)
- **Support for new entities**: Speechly Annotation Language supports natively phone numbers, emails, person names and website addresses. This enables developers to easily build voice experiences that contain these data types, for example something like "Add contact with name Jack Johnston and email address jack dot johnston at gmail dot com"
