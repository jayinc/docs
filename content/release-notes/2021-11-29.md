- **Dashboard**: New sign-up flow and new application configuration view.
- **Speechly API**: New data centers in the US (east and west coasts), UK and Singapore. This reduces transcript latency in client applications.
- **Client libraries and demos**: All of our open-source Client libraries, example applications, and demos are now in the same [GitHub repository](https://github.com/speechly/speechly). Our developer community engagement will in the future be focused around this repository.
