- **Dashboard**: Use whatever case type for Entities and Intents you like: camelCase, snake_case and UPPERCASE are fully supported.
- **Client libraries**: @speechly/browser-client@v1.1.0 library now contains both `ES2015` and `UMD` module bundles that work with HTML `<script>` tag. Use it if you need lower level access to Speechly API than Speechly's Web Components provide. `ES2015` module bundle is now also used for Node, replacing CommonJS modules.
