- **Dashboard**: Use whatever case type for Entities and Intents you like: camelCase, snake_case and UPPERCASE are fully supported.
- **Client libraries**: @speechly/browser-client@v1.1.0 library can now be used with both Node and on a HTML page without build tooling. The npm contains both `ES2015` and `UMD` module bundles that work with `<script>` tag if you need lower level access to Speechly API than Speechly's Web Components provide.
