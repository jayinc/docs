The Client libraries take care of audio capture, bidirectional streaming, authentication, and other technical complexities. They also come bundled with common UI components (a microphone button, transcript view).

# Installing and using the Client Libraries
See [Basic usage instructions](usage) to learn how to install and use the Client libraries.

All Client libraries also adhere to the same [high-level API](client-api-reference). There are some platform specific differences, but conceptually we have tried to make the Clients as similar as possible. If you know how to use one, getting started with another should be easy (provided both platforms are familiar to you).

# More information
Our Client libraries are open source. You can find more information about them as well as other usage examples on Github:
