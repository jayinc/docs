# Speech-to-text: an empty configuration
<table>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
An empty configuration provides a transcript, but no intents or entities. Use this if
<ul>
<li>you want to build your own configuration from scratch,
<li>your application only needs basic transcription capabilities,
<li>you want to try out our non-adapted speech-to-text-service.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
(Note that also speech-to-text accuracy is affected by the configuration. Especially accuracy on domain-specific vocabulary can be significantly increased by providing these as part of your configuration.)
