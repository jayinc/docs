# Speechly libraries

We offer [a variety of libraries](/dev-tools/overview) for integrating Speechly to your application. Our high-level [Client libraries](/client-libraries/), available for for Web, React, iOS, and Android, are the most advanced. They make it easy to interact with the Speechly gRPC API in a conforming way, and we recommend using them whenever possible.

# Dashboard

The Speechly [Dashboard](/dev-tools/dashboard) is where you create, set up, and deploy Speechly applications. The Dashboard provides some simple usage instructions when you log in for the first time.

# Command line tool

Our [Command Line Tool](/dev-tools/command-line-client/) lets you create, set up, and deploy Speechly applications from the command line. Some of our more advanced features are only available when using the Command Line Tool. We recommend beginners to start with the Dashboard.
