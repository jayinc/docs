Speechly is solving voice in a completely novel way. Our API is fully streaming to enable a few key concepts that we think are the missing piece in voice. We have put together a number of best practices that are worth considering when developing your application.

They are split into four short "chapters", with the following content:

# [Chapter 1: Setting the right Context](/design-philosophy/set-right-context/)
- Don't build a Voice Assistant
- Design for Command & Control
- Give visual guidance on what the user can say
- Use voice ONLY for the tasks it's good for

# [Chapter 2: Receiving Commands from the User](/design-philosophy/receive-commands/)
- Onboard the user
- Avoid using a wake word
- Use a Push-to-Talk button
- Signal clearly when the microphone button is pushed down

# [Chapter 3: Giving Feedback to the User](/design-philosophy/give-feedback/)
- Use non-interruptive modalities for feedback
- Minimize latency with Spoken Language Understanding
- Steer userâ€™s gaze and minimize visual unrest

# [Chapter 4: Recovering from Mistakes](/design-philosophy/mitigate-fails/)
- Show the transcript
- Produce results fast, but offer opportunity to correct
- Have an intent for verbal corrections
- Offer alternative ways to complete tasks without Voice
