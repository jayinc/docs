Take a quick tour of Speechly's technology. The tutorial shows example applications, explains how Speechly applications are programmed, what the overall architecture of a Speechly application is, and concludes with a tutorial on how to use the Speechly Web Toolkit to easily add voice features to a website.

The videos are embedded below. You can also view the entire [playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlI47qnvip4&list=PLhhkCt5KRs0_xsBYuJl-Y4EnU1x2Me5ue), it takes less than 17 minutes! (If you don't have that much time, at least check out Part 5 at the bottom of this page!)
