Take a quick tour of Speechly's technology with Collin Borns (Head of Business Development), Antti Ukkonen (Chief Product Officer) and Hannes Heikinheimo (Chief Technology Officer). The tutorial shows example applications, explains how Speechly applications are programmed, what the overall architecture of a Speechly application is, and concludes with a tutorial on how to use the Speechly Web Toolkit to easily add voice features to a website.

The videos are embedded below. You can also view the entire [playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlI47qnvip4&list=PLhhkCt5KRs0_xsBYuJl-Y4EnU1x2Me5ue), it takes less than 17 minutes! (If you don't have that much time, at least check out Part 5 at the bottom of this page!)

## Part 4: The Architecture of a Speechly Powered Application with Antti (1:49 min)

Our client libraries take care of audio capture and streaming, our machine learning models do the processing, and as a developer you just react to simple events returned by our API.
