Below are three different ways for you to start trying out Speechly.

# 1) Video Quick Start

This Quick Start will guide you through the basics of building Spoken Language Understanding models with Speechly Dashboard. It covers the following steps:

1. Creating an application
2. Creating your first Configuration
3. Trying out the application in the Speechly Playground

# 2) Web Integration Quick Start

A walk-through on integrating Speechly to a Web based application can be found in this [simple and plain but very informative tutorial](https://speechly.github.io/browser-ui/v1/). You can either use the ready-made Application Id on the page (Usage section), or replace this with your own (maybe after completing the Video Quick Start).

# 3) Complete Integration
Do you already have an application that you would like to integrate with Speechly?

1. Sign-up on the [Speechly Dashboard](https://api.speechly.com).
2. Deploy the Home Automation Configuration that you can find on the Dashboard when creating a new application. (Also see the video tutorial above.)
3. Install and take a [Client Library](/client-libraries/usage) of your choice into use. They are available for Web, React, iOS and Android. Use the Application Id that you obtained in step 2. above.
4. Make a test utterance from your own application.

Once you've completed this, the next step is to [design a configuration](/slu-examples/) that is tailored for your application.
