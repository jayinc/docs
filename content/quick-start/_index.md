# Overview
Adding voice functionalities to a website or mobile application with Speechly is very similar to traditional event driven UI programming. The main difference is that whereas in "non-voice" UIs callbacks are triggered by the user interacting with some component on the website / application. In Speechly powered UIs this event triggering happens via the user talking.

But as a developer you can still focus on defining what happens when the user says something. The difficult part of turning speech to events is taken care of by our Client libraries and the Speechly API. The figure below illustrates this.

# Getting started
The video below will teach you the basics of using the Speechly [Dashboard](https://www.speechly.com/dashboard) and Playground, as well as guide you through the three steps of
1. setting up the Speechly microphone UI component,
2. configuring an Appid, and
3. binding the events returned by our API to UI functions.

Note that these steps are also related to the three parts of the architecture figure above.
